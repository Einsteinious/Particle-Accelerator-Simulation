# Particle-Accelerator-Simulation
While not a perfect replication of real LHC physics, it incorporates fundamental concepts like energy and momentum conservation.
Models the collision of two protons (p + p) resulting in a proton (p), a neutron (n), and a positively charged pion (π⁺). It’s designed to reflect particle physics and it is mostly accurate, with momentum and energy conservation during collisions.

Used a circular boundary for the simulation, similar to a cyclotron. This boundary will likely lead to more collisions and thus take a bit more time to run (2-6 mins, depending on the number of particles).
#The particles are created at random speeds, so the patterns will always be unique. (which is really cool but sometimes it keeps colliding and produces like 100 particles!)
